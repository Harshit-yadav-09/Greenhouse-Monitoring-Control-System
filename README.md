# Greenhouse-Monitoring-and-Control-System

Welcome to my Greenhouse Monitoring & Control System, a critical IoT project designed to monitor and manage greenhouse environmental conditions in real-time. This system leverages the ESP32 microcontroller for its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, paired with a web interface for remote access. Although the full code is not yet available, the project is documented with a circuit diagram and a live webpage demo.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of greenhouse conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, light levels) via ESP32 sensors.
- Remote control of environmental parameters (e.g., irrigation, ventilation) through the webpage.
- Alerts or status updates displayed on the web interface.
- Automated responses based on sensor data (inferred from typical greenhouse IoT systems).

## Components Used
- ESP32 microcontroller (central controller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth)
- Sensors (e.g., DHT11 for temperature/humidity, LDR for light)
- Relays or actuators (e.g., for fans, water pumps)
- Power supply
- Relay

## Technologies Used
- ESP32 (for hardware control, data processing, and wireless communication)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for the webpage interface)
- Replit to deal with backend

## How to Run
- Clone the repository: `https://github.com/Harshit-yadav-09/Greenhouse-Monitoring-Control-System`
- View the circuit diagram and webpage link for details.


## Live Demo
- Check the live webpage: (https://92a1a36f-9c41-4f80-8bc9-a39da47d6fac-00-16e6i3jwxyvua.picard.replit.dev/)

## Future Improvements
- Add data logging to track conditions over time.
- Enhance the webpage with real-time graphs using ESP32 data.
- Integrate additional sensors (e.g., soil moisture, CO2 levels) via ESP32.
